Retropie 4.6 28th April 2020

Changes since 4.5

- Raspberry Pi 4 support! Support is labelled as beta currently as there are still things to improve, but most emulators now run well.
- The RetroPie images are now based on Raspbian Buster - Stretch is no longer supported by Raspberry Pi (Trading) ltd. RetroPie will stop updating pre-built binaries for Stretch later in the year.
- Improvements to RetroPie packaging system and core RetroPie-Setup code so package state is remembered and binary updates will only be done if an updated binary is available. Source installs won't be overwritten by a pre-built binary when updating also. We started providing pre-built binaries for the packages in the experimental section for the supported platforms.
